# Snoopy 
This project is my first foray into experimenting with security on the public internet. Some of 
these tools will have a Blue Team feel, and others might have a Red Team feel.

## Installation
Install the repository with `git clone https://github.com/scott-robbins/Snoopy`

## Usage
To discover active hosts on the lan and see what ports are open just run `python utils.py curious`

For more targeted scans, you scan run somethig like the following `python utils.py -scan <IP Address>`
